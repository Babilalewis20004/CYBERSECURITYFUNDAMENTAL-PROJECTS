1.) Web 1.0 is often referred to as the "read-only web," where users could only view static content. It was mainly about browsing and consuming information1.

Web 2.0 introduced interactivity and user-generated content. This era saw the rise of social media, blogs, and websites that allowed users to interact, share, and collaborate1.

Web 3.0, or Web3, is the next evolution, focusing on decentralization, openness, and greater user utility. It leverages technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence to create a more user-centric and decentralized web.

2.) The front end is what users see and interact with directly. It includes the design, layout, colors, buttons, and overall user experience (UX)3. Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create these visual elements.

The back end, on the other hand, is the server-side part of the application that users don't see. It handles the logic, database interactions, user authentication, and server configuration3. Back-end developers work with server-side languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.

3.) 
DNS Lookup: The browser queries a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the URL into an IP address.

HTTP Request: The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server at the IP address.

Server Processing: The server processes the request, retrieves the necessary data from the database or files, and prepares an HTTP response.

Response: The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser.

Rendering: The browser receives the response and renders the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the web page

  3 signs of illegitimate email.
- Email address: the sender's email address "fruad_servces@bank.com" contains spelling errors and unusual formatting, which is a red flag.
- Urgency and Threat: Genuine banks typically do not create a sense of urgency or threaten immediate consequences via email.
- Attachments: Legitimate institutions usually direct you to their official website for forms and do not send them as zip file attachments, especially without prior notification.
  
  It is possible your computer is infected with malware. 
  The zip folder could have contained a malicious file disguised as a PDF. 
  When you opened it, the malware could have executed, compromising your system and causing the slowdown you experienced.
  

   Education and awareness about cyber crime.
       Phishing and social engineering are common tactics used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. 
       Phishing attacks often come as seemingly legitimate emails, urging you to act quickly. They may contain links to fake websites or attachments with malicious software. 
       To avoid falling victim, always scrutinize the sender's email address for errors, be wary of unsolicited attachments, and avoid clicking on links from unknown sources. 
       Verify the authenticity of urgent requests by contacting the institution directly through official channels. 
       Moreover, keep your software updated and use antivirus programs to detect and prevent malware infections. 
       Training and awareness are crucial; by staying informed and cautious, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats. Stay vigilant and think before you click.

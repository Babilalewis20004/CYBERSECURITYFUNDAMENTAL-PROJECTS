    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p><b>Memory:</b> I used to spend hours drawing cartoon characters. It was a wonderful way to express my creativity.</p>
    <p><i>Memory:</i> I remember winning an art competition in school with a drawing of a nature scene. It made me so proud!</p>
    
    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p><b>Memory:</b> I loved reading adventure books. I would get lost in the stories for hours on end.</p>
    <p><i>Memory:</i> My parents bought me a collection of classic novels for my birthday, which I still cherish today.</p>
    
    <h1>Toys</h1>
    <h2>Action Figures</h2>
    <p><b>Memory:</b> My action figures were my favorite toys. I created epic battles and adventures with them.</p>
    <p><i>Memory:</i> I used to swap action figures with my friends, which made playtime even more exciting.</p>
    
    <h2>Building Blocks</h2>
    <p><b>Memory:</b> I built everything from castles to spaceships with my building blocks. It was like having a new toy every day.</p>
    <p><i>Memory:</i> I once constructed a huge tower that almost reached the ceiling, and I felt like a little architect.</p>
